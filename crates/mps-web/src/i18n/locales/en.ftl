# ---- Gravity page ----
grav-tag = // mps-core

batch-field-translation = Local translation relative to the merged collider origin
batch-field-rotation = Unit quaternion local rotation
batch-field-friction = Coulomb friction coefficient (>= 0)
batch-field-restitution = Coefficient of restitution (>= 0, typically < 1)
batch-field-density = Mass density (>= 0; ignored for static shapes)
batch-field-collision-groups = Collision group memberships bitmask
batch-field-solver-groups = Solver group memberships bitmask
batch-field-body-parent = When non-zero, attaches collider to the given rigid body
batch-field-is-sensor = When non-zero, the collider is a sensor (no collision response)
batch-field-erosion-margin = Erosion margin; only meaningful for round shapes; 0 = no erosion
batch-preset-title = Box3D physics-feel presets
batch-preset-lead = Three built-in presets cover common sandbox physics scenarios; also available via FFI constructors.
batch-preset-default-title = Default
batch-preset-default-desc = Balanced — moderate friction, slight bounce, gentle damping. Good for general sandbox use.
batch-preset-sticky-title = Sticky
batch-preset-sticky-desc = No bounce, high friction. Good for ground/walls and static geometry.
batch-preset-bouncy-title = Bouncy
batch-preset-bouncy-desc = Low friction, high restitution, more CCD substeps. Good for bouncing/stacking demos.
batch-merge-title = Merge strategy
batch-merge-lead = The manager groups by material, collision groups, sensor flag, and parent body; same-group static shapes merge into a compound.
batch-merge-same-material = Same material + same collision groups + static
batch-merge-compound = Merged into a single compound collider (one insert)
batch-merge-diff-material = Different material or different collision groups
batch-merge-separate = Each gets its own collider (multiple inserts)
batch-merge-dynamic-parent = Attached to a dynamic rigid body
batch-merge-attach = Attached via insert_with_parent to the parent body
batch-merge-sensor = Sensor flag is true
batch-merge-sensor-result = Sensor collider does not participate in collision response, only triggers events
batch-erosion-title = Erosion
batch-erosion-lead = Rapier/parry has no built-in clone_eroded API; we rebuild the shape as its round variant with border_radius = erosion_margin.
batch-erosion-cuboid = Converts a hard-edge cuboid to a round cuboid, reducing jitter when stacked.
batch-erosion-cylinder = Cylinder to round cylinder; edge contact is smoother.
batch-erosion-cone = Cone to round cone; the tip is blunted to prevent penetration.
batch-erosion-note = Ball / Capsule shapes are already round; erosion does not change their geometry. Ball and unsupported shapes fall back to shape_from_desc.
batch-ffi-title = FFI entry points
batch-ffi-lead = All pub extern "C" fn; payloads are #[repr(C)] flat structs; cbindgen generates the rigid_body.h header.
batch-limits-title = Capacity limits
batch-limit-max-requests = MAX_BATCH_REQUESTS = 100 000 — maximum requests per batch.
batch-limit-max-compound = MAX_COMPOUND_PARTS = 50 000 — maximum parts in a single compound.
batch-limit-erosion-zero = When erosion_margin = 0, round-variant rebuild is skipped and the original shape is used directly.
batch-example-title = Rust usage example
batch-example-lead = Build a ColliderRequest array, pass to batch_add_colliders; same-material shapes auto-merge into a compound.

# ---- JNI page ----
jni-tag = // mps-jni
jni-title = Java JNI Bindings
jni-desc = mps-jni exports { $methods } methods to org.polaris2023.mps.rapier.RapierNative via the jni! / jni_e_c! macros.
jni-codegen-title = Macro code generation
jni-codegen-lead = Two declarative macros wrap a Rust closure into an export_named JNI symbol; type tables live in @ty / @default arms.
jni-codegen-body = jni! handles plain methods that don't need JNIEnv; jni_e_c! adds the env / class types for callback-install methods and reuses jni!'s type table (see OPTIMIZATION.md §5.A).
jni-codegen-note = The macro body wraps the closure in catch_unwind(AssertUnwindSafe); on failure it falls back to @default instead of aborting the JVM process.
jni-panic-title = Panic isolation
jni-panic-lead = Any Rust panic is mapped by catch_unwind to ERR_INTERNAL and a zero value of the declared return type.
jni-panic-body = A JVM abort is almost unrecoverable, so each export fn has a panic net; the side effect is dirty state — callers should bracket suspect calls between world_step and check last_error_code().
jni-mangle-title = Symbol mangling
jni-mangle-desc = The export_name must match the Java class FQN exactly: '.' becomes underscore, and '_' inside an identifier becomes '_1'.
jni-col-class = Java class
jni-col-symbol = Exported symbol prefix
jni-mangle-note = Forgetting _1 makes System.load succeed but dlsym fail → UnsatisfiedLinkError; RigidBodyNative must use mps_1rigid_1body, RapierNative needs no _1.
jni-groups-title = API surface groups ({ $ffi } extern C entries)
jni-group-abi-title = ABI / version
jni-group-abi-desc = abiVersion / abiSupportsFfm / abiSupportsJni / last_error_code / last_error_message / clear.
jni-group-world-title = world_*
jni-group-world-desc = create / step / destroy / gravity / force-law install / event registration. 117 FFI entries.
jni-group-rb-title = rigid_body_*
jni-group-rb-desc = builder chain / state read-write / axis locks / mass_properties. 62 FFI entries.
jni-group-collider-title = collider_*
jni-group-collider-desc = shape build / friction restitution / collision groups / sensors. 75 FFI entries.
jni-group-query-title = query_*
jni-group-query-desc = ray_cast / shape_cast / point / intersection / R-tree culling. 58 FFI entries.
jni-group-events-title = events / ForceLaw
jni-group-events-desc = collision + contact-force ring buffer; Coulomb / AirDrag / Newton / custom force-law install.
jni-group-forces-title = Physics force laws (C1–C4 expansion)
jni-group-forces-desc = solar-wind dynamic pressure / Eddington radiation pressure / X-ray irradiation / pulsar magnetic-dipole torque / Jeans escape / MOND gravity.
jni-group-aero-title = Aerodynamics / fluid
jni-group-aero-desc = aero_apply_surfaces / aero_apply_voxel_grid / fluid AABB drag and buoyancy.
jni-group-arena-title = Arena zero-copy bridge
jni-group-arena-desc = arenaAsDirectByteBuffer / arena_read_double / arena_write_double — read/write physics state without JNI round-trips.
jni-group-cosmos-title = cosmos_*
jni-group-cosmos-desc = CosmosWorld create / celestial registration / n-body mutual gravity / Verlet advance / step_n batch.
jni-group-spaceflight-title = spaceflight_*
jni-group-spaceflight-desc = orbital perturbation / specific impulse / propellant budget / write acceleration output to a native buffer (out_accel).
jni-handle-title = Handle packing
jni-handle-lead = RigidBodyHandle folds into a single jlong: high 32 bits store the index, low 32 bits the generation, matching Rapier's into_raw_parts() order.
jni-handle-note = Not splitting into two jints keeps ABI alignment with RigidBodyHandleRaw (a single u64) and avoids a generation race between two JNI reads.
jni-arena-title = Zero-copy Arena bridge
jni-arena-lead = arenaAsDirectByteBuffer uses NewDirectByteBuffer (a standard JNI API since Java 1.4) to expose the native Arena memory directly as a java.nio.ByteBuffer.
jni-arena-body = The Java side reads/writes purely through DoubleBuffer with no JNI upcalls; the per-frame native→jdoubleArray copy disappears, and the hot path barely sees JNI scheduling.
jni-deploy-title = Deployment
jni-deploy-lib = The cargo build --release -p mps-jni product mps_rigid_body.dll goes into src/main/resources/natives/.
jni-deploy-load = On the Java side, System.load("mps_rigid_body") per architecture; on failure UnsatisfiedLinkError will carry the offending symbol name.
jni-deploy-version = ABI is negotiated via abiVersion(); mps-web self-reports v{ $version }, any runtime mismatch should cause the caller to abort.
# ---- FFM page ----
ffm-tag = // MPS
ffm-title = Java FFM Bindings
ffm-desc = ABI probing and version negotiation entrypoint for the Foreign Function & Memory API (JEP 454), targeting Java 25+ callers.
ffm-what-title = FFM's role here
ffm-what-lead = mps-ffm is a three-function lightweight crate: it only exposes the ABI version and per-end capability bits for runtime negotiation.
ffm-what-body = The actual rigid_body.h entries are still down-called by the Java side directly through Linker.downcallHandle; crates/mps-ffm does NOT replicate any method signature. Its job is to let Java get abi_version() the moment the .dll/.so is loaded, and decide whether to take the FFM or JNI path.
ffm-surface-title = ABI surface
ffm-surface-lead = Three #[unsafe(no_mangle)] extern C functions with #[repr(C)] Bool return values.
ffm-surface-note = Pure ABI probing with no world access; Java Linker down-calls these first, then switches into world_create / world_step etc.
ffm-vs-title = JNI vs FFM comparison
ffm-col-feature = Feature
ffm-row-min-java = Minimum Java
ffm-row-binding = Binding style
ffm-row-jni-bind = Java native methods + javah header generation
ffm-row-ffm-bind = Linker.downcallHandle + FunctionDescriptor
ffm-row-overhead = Call overhead
ffm-row-jni-over = High (Env per call)
ffm-row-ffm-over = Near-native (compile-time ABI direct link)
ffm-row-memory = Memory management
ffm-row-jni-mem = GetXxxArrayElements + release
ffm-row-ffm-mem = MemorySegment slicing the Arena directly
ffm-row-panic = Panic handling
ffm-row-jni-panic = catch_unwind maps to ERR_INTERNAL
ffm-row-ffm-panic = Caller must respect Rust conventions on its own (UB otherwise)
ffm-layout-title = Linker downcall layout
ffm-layout-desc = The Java side writes a FunctionDescriptor from the C ABI describing args and return types; the Linker produces a method handle invoked via invokeExact.
ffm-header-title = C ABI input
ffm-header-lead = Java treats rigid_body.h as the contract and mirrors #[repr(C)] structs via memory layouts.
ffm-header-cbindgen = The cbindgen-generated rigid_body.h (~5400 lines) is the single source of truth.
ffm-header-structs = Vec3 / Quat / ShapeDesc / event records are all #[repr(C)] flat; Java MemoryLayout computes offsets.
ffm-header-load = Linker + SymbolLookup.loaderLookup() loads mps_rigid_body with no JNIEnv dependency.
ffm-header-note = Any cbindgen field change forces a Java layout update; abi_version() is the version gatekeeper.
ffm-alloc-title = Allocation strategy
ffm-alloc-segment-title = MemorySegment
ffm-alloc-segment-desc = Each call allocates a temporary segment; the arena allocator closes them together with a clear lifetime.
ffm-alloc-arena-title = Shared Arena
ffm-alloc-arena-desc = Bulk state read/write goes through the mps-core Arena; Java gets a DirectByteBuffer wrapper, zero-copy.
ffm-alloc-shared-title = Foundation
ffm-alloc-shared-desc = JNI and FFM both share the mps-core Arena state — different routes, same destination.
ffm-status-title = Current status
ffm-status-body = mps-ffm remains a capability-probing crate; the full JEP 454 downcall bindings are constructed at runtime by the Java side — no generator path yet.
# ---- API Reference page ----
api-tag = // MPS
api-title = API Reference
api-desc = crates/mps-core/include/rigid_body.h exposes { $total } pub extern C entries.
api-header-title = Header surface
api-header-lead = cbindgen 0.29.4 generates it from mps-core's build.rs; { $total } FFI functions plus all #[repr(C)] types are listed.
api-header-body = Do NOT hand-edit — any change comes from a pub extern C in mps-core's rapier module; build regenerates it.
api-prefix-title = Function prefix groups
api-prefix-lead = Each export function name has a physics-subsystem prefix; grepping the prefix lists all entries of that module.
api-col-prefix = Prefix
api-col-count = Count
api-col-domain = Responsibility
api-row-world = World / gravity / force laws / events / step
api-row-rigid = RigidBody state / mass / axis locks
api-row-collider = shapes / friction / collision groups / sensors
api-row-query = ray cast / shape cast / point projection / sweeps
api-prefix-note = The sum matches CORE_FFI_COUNT; unlisted prefixes (aero_ / fluid_ / trajectory_ / anvilkit_ / cosmos_ / molecular_ / events / force law) live in their domain sections.
api-handles-title = Common handle types
api-col-type = Type
api-col-scope = Scope
api-handle-world = Physics world; lifecycle from world_create to world_destroy.
api-handle-rigid = Rigid body index+generation, packed as u64, reused across calls.
api-handle-collider = Collider index+generation; may be detached from its parent rigid body.
api-handle-rb-build = Builder chain; ownership transfers on insert_with_parent.
api-handle-col-build = Collider builder; ownership transfers to world on build_insert.
api-handle-joint = Joint builder; voided after world_add_impulse_joint succeeds.
api-handle-rtree = Broad-phase R-tree for collider/query culling.
api-handle-crbtree = C-side red-black tree for joints / collision pairs, O(log n) queries.
api-handle-cc = Character controller handle wrapping capsule scan + contact solve.
api-records-title = Flat record types
api-records-lead = All #[repr(C)] flat, written cleanly by Java / JNI / FFM ends alike.
api-record-vec3 = Vec3 — three f64 axes in x/y/z order.
api-record-quat = Quat — (i, j, k, w) quaternion; builders convert to axis-angle.
api-record-aabb = AabbDesc — min/max + user tag for query ranges.
api-record-shape = ShapeDesc — shape_type + a/b/c/d params, covering sphere / cuboid / capsule / cone etc.
api-record-event = CollisionEventRecord / ContactForceEventRecord — event ring buffer payloads.
api-record-filter = QueryFilterDesc / InteractionGroupsDesc — query filter bitmasks.
api-error-title = Error reporting
api-error-lead = A thread-local error code + message; always check the function return value first.
api-error-note = Subsequent calls in the same frame overwrite the previous error; you must last_error_clear() immediately after a read to judge the next failure cleanly.
api-lifecycle-title = World lifecycle call sample
api-stability-title = ABI stability contract
api-stability-cbindgen = rigid_body.h is cbindgen-generated; skipping hand-edits is a hard error.
api-stability-repr = All public structs are #[repr(C)] with fixed field order, alignment, and padding.
api-stability-version = abi_version() is the mandatory negotiation entry; callers must abort on runtime mismatch.
api-stability-redline = Formula modules may only expose crate-internal pub fn; only pub extern C fn enter rigid_body.h. The C ABI red line is guarded by cargo build -p mps-core + a header git diff.

# ---- Soft Body (Phases 0–21) ----
soft-tag = Soft Body
soft-title = Soft Body Physics
soft-desc = XPBD / MassSpring deformable bodies — cloth, tetrahedral volume meshes, voxel terrain, 22 capability upgrades (Phases 0–21), plus a zero-fork FFI safety line (Phases 22–25): contact-force readback, per-particle impulse, AABB readback, deep clone, binary state save/restore, and per-particle velocity write.

soft-overview-title = Overview
soft-overview-lead = A soft body is a collection of particles connected by distance constraints (XPBD) and/or springs (MassSpring), optionally wrapped in a triangle shell or a tetrahedral volume mesh.
soft-overview-body = Every soft body owns an independent gravity field, a sleep/wake state, and a set of XPBD distance constraints plus MassSpring springs. The solver is selected per body via soft_body_configure_solver — XPBD for stiff structural cloth/flesh, MassSpring for bouncy rope/jelly. All state is exposed read-write through the Arena, so Java reads particles/tetrahedra/triangles/edges with zero per-object JNI.

soft-solver-title = Solver
soft-solver-desc = Two solvers share the same particle buffer; switch with soft_body_configure_solver(world, id, solver, iterations, dt).
soft-solver-li-1 = XPBD — rigid-compliance distance constraints with per-constraint compliance and compression; pairs with tetrahedral volume conservation for incompressible flesh.
soft-solver-li-2 = MassSpring — Hookean springs (soft_body_add_spring) with per-spring stiffness; cheap and stable for ropes, cloth, and gelatin.
soft-solver-li-3 = Per-constraint anisotropic compliance (soft_body_set_distance_constraint_compliance) lets an edge resist stretch differently along its axis for directional stiffness.

soft-data-title = Data Model
soft-data-desc = A soft body is four parallel arrays plus two constraint sets; all are Arena-readable.
soft-data-li-1 = Particles — soft_body_add_particle(pos, inv_mass, pinned); read via soft_body_read_particles.
soft-data-li-2 = Tetrahedra — soft_body_add_tetrahedron(a,b,c,d) for volume meshes; rest volume cached for conservation; read via soft_body_read_tetrahedra.
soft-data-li-3 = Triangles — soft_body_add_triangle(a,b,c) build the shell; read via soft_body_read_triangles.
soft-data-li-4 = Edges — springs and distance constraints; read via soft_body_read_edges.

soft-cap-title = Capability Matrix (Phases 0–21)
soft-cap-lead = Each card maps to a real soft_body_* FFI delivered in the workspace. Phases 22–25 add a zero-fork FFI safety line (see below).

soft-cap-01-title = Base Body & Particles
soft-cap-01-desc = soft_body_create + soft_body_add_particle; free or pinned particles with independent inv_mass. The foundation every later feature builds on.
soft-cap-02-title = Triangle Shell
soft-cap-02-desc = soft_body_add_triangle registers the 3 structural edges as distance constraints; the shell drives cloth and surface contact.
soft-cap-03-title = Tetrahedral Volume Mesh
soft-cap-03-desc = soft_body_add_tetrahedron + soft_body_build_tetra_mesh build an incompressible volumetric body; rest volumes are cached for volume conservation.
soft-cap-04-title = Springs (MassSpring)
soft-cap-04-desc = soft_body_add_spring + soft_body_set_spring_stiffness — Hookean links for ropes, cloth, and jelly with tunable stiffness.
soft-cap-05-title = Distance Constraints
soft-cap-05-desc = soft_body_add_distance_constraint with per-constraint compliance and compression; the XPBD structural backbone.
soft-cap-06-title = Cloth & Bending
soft-cap-06-desc = soft_body_add_bending adds angular bending resistance on top of the triangle shell for stiff fabric and fol-do-not-collapse surfaces.
soft-cap-07-title = Wind Field
soft-cap-07-desc = soft_body_apply_wind + soft_body_clear_wind — aerodynamic drag on the shell using triangle normals; flags via soft_body_apply_wind_flag.
soft-cap-08-title = Sleep Diagnostics
soft-cap-08-desc = soft_body_is_sleeping / soft_body_sleep / soft_body_wake — persistent-island sleep states keep a settled body off the solver.
soft-cap-09-title = Rigid Anchoring
soft-cap-09-desc = soft_body_attach_particle / soft_body_detach_particle bind a particle to a rigid body (fixed point, rope end, pinned cloth corner).
soft-cap-10-title = Tearing
soft-cap-10-desc = soft_body_set_tear_strain — a distance constraint breaks when its strain exceeds the threshold, so cloth rips under load.
soft-cap-11-title = Plasticity
soft-cap-11-desc = soft_body_set_plasticity — constraints retain a fraction of deformation as permanent offset, so soft bodies dent and stay dented.
soft-cap-12-title = Pressurization
soft-cap-12-desc = soft_body_set_pressure — an internal pressure force inflates the tetrahedral mesh (balloons, airbags, bladders).
soft-cap-13-title = Self-Collision
soft-cap-13-desc = soft_body_set_self_collision — particles repel each other within a radius; keeps a folded body from passing through itself.
soft-cap-14-title = Soft–Soft Collision
soft-cap-14-desc = soft_body_set_cross_collision — two soft bodies resolve contact against each other (piling, stacking, squishing).
soft-cap-15-title = Independent Gravity
soft-cap-15-desc = soft_body_set_gravity — each body carries its own gravity vector, decoupled from the world gravity used by rigid bodies.
soft-cap-16-title = Volume Conservation
soft-cap-16-desc = soft_body_set_volume_conservation + soft_body_total_volume — an XPBD constraint holds total tetrahedral volume (incompressible flesh, water balloons).
soft-cap-17-title = Cohesion
soft-cap-17-desc = soft_body_set_cohesion — nearby particles inside a capture radius are pulled together (surface tension, sticky droplets, wet sand).
soft-cap-18-title = Structural Damping
soft-cap-18-desc = soft_body_set_damping — velocity-proportional damping suppresses jitter and rings the body to rest.
soft-cap-19-title = Anisotropic Compliance
soft-cap-19-desc = soft_body_set_distance_constraint_compliance — per-edge directional compliance for stiff-warp / soft-weft cloth and directional flesh.
soft-cap-20-title = Soft–Soft Friction
soft-cap-20-desc = soft_body_set_self_collision_friction + soft_body_set_cross_collision_friction — Coulomb tangential damping on self and cross contacts (μ ∈ [0,1]).
soft-cap-21-title = Adaptive Tetrahedral Subdivision
soft-cap-21-desc = soft_body_subdivide_tetrahedra — barycentric 1→4 split of tets whose longest edge exceeds a threshold; sub-volumes sum to the parent so volume stays conserved.
soft-cap-22-title = Read/Write API
soft-cap-22-desc = soft_body_read_particles / _read_tetrahedra / _read_triangles / _read_edges + soft_body_get_particle — the full body state flows through the zero-copy Arena.

soft-p25-title = FFI Safety Line (Phases 22–25)
soft-p25-lead = Six pure mps-core additions — each walks the SoftBody public fields directly, none touches the rapier3d fork. They expose state read-back, clone, binary (de)serialization, and direct velocity write for save/restore, replay, and networked soft-body snapshots.
soft-p25-1-title = Contact-Force Readback
soft-p25-1-desc = soft_body_read_contact_force — per-particle total contact impulse from the collision proxy, split by which collider it hit. Read-only diagnostics for grasp/squish force.
soft-p25-2-title = Per-Particle Impulse
soft-p25-2-desc = soft_body_apply_particle_impulse — p.vel += J·inv_mass; pinned (inv_mass==0) is a no-op. Kick a single node without rebuilding the body.
soft-p25-3-title = AABB / Centroid Readback
soft-p25-3-desc = soft_body_read_aabb — min/max corner and centroid from particle positions; any out pointer may be null to skip it.
soft-p25-4-title = Deep Clone
soft-p25-4-desc = soft_body_clone — SoftBody::clone into a fresh id with collide=false, so the copy integrates independently and never shares the source proxy.
soft-p25-5-title = Binary State Save / Restore
soft-p25-5-desc = soft_body_state_size + soft_body_save_state + soft_body_restore_state — hand-rolled little-endian blob over every public field (Option/enum/RigidBodyHandle packed via into_raw_parts). Corrupt magic/version/truncation returns FALSE with no half-built body left behind.
soft-p25-6-title = Per-Particle Velocity Write
soft-p25-6-desc = soft_body_set_particle_velocity — overwrite particle.vel; pinned / out-of-range / unknown id return FALSE. The write counterpart to soft_body_get_particle.

soft-p25-map-title = Phase 25 FFI <-> JNI  (zero-fork, mps-core only)
soft-p25-map-note = Each C FFI maps 1:1 to a Java JNI method. All eight walk the SoftBody public fields directly and never touch the rapier3d fork. Return + guard column shows the success type and the failure path.
soft-p25-map-body = FFI                                      JNI                               ret / guard

  soft_body_state_size                 softBodyStateSize                u32 bytes / fail -> u32::MAX
  soft_body_save_state                 softBodySaveState                u32 written / small buf -> u32::MAX
  soft_body_restore_state              softBodyRestoreState             u32 new id / bad magic -> u32::MAX
  soft_body_set_particle_velocity      softBodySetParticleVelocity      bool / pinned|oob|bad id -> false

soft-api-title = FFI Surface
soft-api-desc = The soft-body subsystem is exposed symmetrically across C FFI, Java JNI, and the integration tests.
soft-api-stat-ffi = C FFI functions
soft-api-stat-jni = JNI methods
soft-api-stat-tests = integration tests

cw-tag = // mps-cosmos
cw-title = World & Bodies
cw-desc = CosmosWorld — an independent orbital-scale world, separate from mps-core's Rapier World.
cw-overview-title = Overview
cw-overview-lead = A CosmosWorld owns its own integration domain: a central body, the Sun, and a catalogue of celestial bodies.
cw-overview-body = Unlike mps-core, there is no rigid-body contact solver — CosmosWorld advances bodies purely through gravity + integrator. Bodies are inserted individually (cosmos_world_insert_body) or as gravity sources (cosmos_world_insert_body_as_gravity_source), and the Sun / central body are configured via cosmos_world_set_sun_position / cosmos_world_set_central_body.

cw-bodies-desc = cosmos_world_add_celestial injects a body from the JPL DE441 dataset (GM, elements, phase). The 10 primary bodies are registered at init; user bodies are added on top.
cw-batch-title = Batch insertion
cw-batch-desc = cosmos_world_add_n_body submits many spacecraft states in one call rather than per-body, matching the cosmosWorldDynamicBodySnapshot bulk read-back pattern for tracking-queue workloads.

cw-ffi-desc = The world layer exposes the create / build / insert / step lifecycle.
cw-ffi-1 = cosmos_world_create / cosmos_world_destroy — own the orbital world.

cw-ffi-3 = cosmos_builder_set_gravity_scale / _set_linear_damping / _set_angular_damping / _lock_translations — body parameters.
cw-ffi-4 = cosmos_world_insert_body / cosmos_world_insert_body_as_gravity_source — add to the world.
cw-ffi-5 = cosmos_world_set_central_body / cosmos_world_set_sun_position / cosmos_world_set_perturbation — domain config.

cg-overview-lead = Every frame computes GM·m/r² across all bodies — the signature trait of CosmosWorld.
cg-overview-body = gravity.rs models three regimes: a single point-mass acceleration (point_mass_acceleration), the full pairwise mutual sum (n_body_acceleration / n_body_acceleration_reduce, O(N²)), and a SIMD far-field monopole approximation (far_field_monopole_simd) for the high-count case. The near/far split is governed by near_field_threshold, monopole, and irregular.
cg-fn-title = Functions
cg-fn-desc = Pure helpers in gravity.rs; bodies call them during step.
cg-fn-1 = point_mass_acceleration / celestial_acceleration — acceleration from one source.
cg-fn-2 = n_body_acceleration / n_body_acceleration_reduce — pairwise mutual gravity over all bodies.
cg-fn-3 = far_field_monopole_simd — SIMD monopole sum for the far field.
cg-fn-4 = gm_from_mass — GM from mass via the gravitational constant.
cg-fn-5 = monopole / irregular / near_field_threshold — toggle near-field vs far-field treatment.
cg-ffi-title = Gravity source FFI
cg-ffi-desc = cosmos_world_insert_body_as_gravity_source lets a body attract others without being integrated; cosmos_hill_radius_for (orbit page) sizes the sphere of influence.
ci-tag = // mps-cosmos
ci-title = Integrators
ci-desc = Verlet stepping plus high-order and Kahan-compensated steppers for long arcs.
ci-overview-title = Overview
ci-overview-lead = CosmosWorld integrates with velocity-Verlet by default, with higher-order options for precision.
ci-overview-body = integrator.rs provides verlet_step as the baseline, and explicit_highorder_step / advance_highorder for higher-order accuracy. advance_highorder_kahan / explicit_highorder_kahan_step add Kahan summation compensation so long-duration arcs (years of simulation) do not drift from floating-point round-off. total_acceleration folds gravity + perturbation into one vector; snapshot_source_positions caches source positions for the far field.
ci-fn-title = Functions
ci-fn-desc = The stepper family in integrator.rs.
ci-fn-1 = verlet_step — baseline velocity-Verlet advance.
ci-fn-2 = explicit_highorder_step / advance_highorder — higher-order integration.
ci-fn-3 = explicit_highorder_kahan_step / advance_highorder_kahan — Kahan-compensated, low drift over long arcs.
ci-fn-4 = total_acceleration — gravity + perturbation summed.
ci-fn-5 = snapshot_source_positions — cache source positions for the far field.
ci-toggle-title = Parallel & SIMD toggles
ci-toggle-desc = nb_parallel_enabled switches the pairwise sum to a rayon parallel path; ff_simd_enabled turns on the SIMD far-field monopole. Both default on for the solar-system scale.
co-tag = // mps-cosmos
co-title = Orbit & Diagnostics
co-desc = Six-element conversion, Hill radius, mean motion, eccentricity vector, Kozai period, and state snapshots.
co-overview-title = Overview
co-overview-lead = orbit.rs / orbit_diagnostics.rs turn state vectors into classical elements and back, and expose diagnostics for monitoring drift.
co-overview-body = The six Keplerian elements convert to/from Cartesian via orbit.rs. orbit_diagnostics.rs adds mean_motion, mean_motion_ratio, eccentricity_vector, and kozai_period (the Kozai–Lidov cycle period). cosmos_hill_radius_for sizes the Hill sphere of influence for a body. State snapshots (cosmos_world_dynamic_body_snapshot / _count) let Java read every body's position/velocity without per-body JNI.
co-fn-title = Functions
co-fn-desc = Element and diagnostic helpers.
co-fn-1 = Six-element ↔ Cartesian conversion (orbit.rs).
co-fn-2 = cosmos_hill_radius_for — Hill sphere radius for a body.
co-fn-3 = mean_motion / mean_motion_ratio — orbital rate and resonance ratio.
co-fn-4 = eccentricity_vector — orbit shape / orientation.
co-fn-5 = kozai_period — Kozai–Lidov oscillation period.
co-snap-title = State snapshots
co-snap-desc = cosmos_world_dynamic_body_snapshot_count + cosmos_world_dynamic_body_snapshot bulk-export every dynamic body's state through the Arena for drift monitoring and plotting.
cf-tag = // mps-cosmos
cf-title = Flight & Perturbation
cf-desc = Two-centre dynamics, trim, longitudinal stability, and environmental perturbations.

cf-trim-title = Trim
cf-trim-desc = flight/trim.rs — hover_target / level_flight_target define the desired equilibrium; trim solves control surfaces for it.
cf-stab-title = Stability
cf-stab-desc = flight/stability.rs — linearize builds the state matrix; longitudinal_modes / longitudinal_submatrix expose the short/phugoid modes; power_iteration finds the dominant eigenvalue.
cf-pert-title = Perturbation
cf-pert-desc = perturbation/* — atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure as forces (reuses mps_formula::spaceflight), injected before each step.
ca-tag = // mps-cosmos
ca-title = Arena & JNI
ca-desc = Cosmos ships its own SharedArena (COSMAREN) — the orbital-scale twin of mps-core's shared_arena.
ca-overview-title = Overview
ca-overview-lead = Java reads/writes body state through a DirectByteBuffer with no per-body JNI call.
ca-overview-body = arena.rs holds a seqlock-guarded body slot; ffi.rs exposes the address and size so Java maps it as a DirectByteBuffer. This mirrors mps-core's arena bridge but is sized for orbital bodies. cosmos_world_get_shared_arena_address / _size parallel worldGetArenaDirectByteBuffer.
ca-ffi-title = Arena FFI
ca-ffi-desc = Create / destroy / query the shared arena.
ca-ffi-1 = cosmos_world_create_shared_arena / cosmos_world_destroy_shared_arena — own the Arena.
ca-ffi-2 = cosmos_world_get_shared_arena_address / cosmos_world_get_shared_arena_size — map into Java.
ca-ffi-3 = cosmos_world_dynamic_body_snapshot(_count) — bulk body state through the Arena.
ca-jni-title = JNI batch API
ca-jni-desc = mps-jni exposes cosmosWorld* methods; bulk state read-back goes through cosmosWorldDynamicBodySnapshot / cosmosWorldDynamicBodySnapshotCount over the Arena (no per-body JNI).

moons-title = Natural Satellites (Moons)
moons-desc = Precision data for { $count } regular moons of the major planets, preloaded in `mps_formula::celestial_data::MOONS` (NASA Planetary Fact Sheet / JPL).
moons-catalog-title = Satellite catalogue
moons-catalog-lead = Each moon is a point-mass gravity source. GM is in 10^9 m3/s2, radius and semi-major axis in km, orbital period in days (retrograde orbits use the absolute magnitude).
moons-source-note = Sources: NASA Planetary Fact Sheet, JPL. Irregular inner satellites carry small eccentricities; values are mean elements.
moons-col-planet = Parent planet
moons-col-name = Moon
moons-col-gm = GM (10^9 m3/s2)
moons-col-radius = Radius (km)
moons-col-sma = Semi-major axis (km)
moons-col-period = Period (days)
moons-ffi-title = Inject a moon into a CosmosWorld
moons-ffi-lead = Moons reuse the celestial gravity infrastructure via `add_moon`, which converts a `Moon` to a `CelestialBody` (max_degree=0, no spherical harmonics) and registers it as a gravity source.
moons-ffi-body = cosmos_world_add_moon(world: *mut CosmosWorld, moon_index: i32) -> i32

# character_body / sensor_zone / vehicle_controller (Phase 3c/3d/3e)
nav-character-body = Character Body
char-tag = New body type
char-title = Character Body
char-desc = A kinematic character controller that drives a kinematic-position-based rigid body - walk, slide, and step over terrain without tunnelling.
char-overview-title = Overview
char-overview-lead = The character body wraps rapier's KinematicCharacterController and a kinematic rigid body.
char-overview-body = You create a character with a shape plus translation, then each step call character_body_move with the desired translation. The controller shape-casts against the world to resolve collisions, slopes and steps, and the result is written back to the kinematic body.
char-api-title = C ABI
char-api-desc = Four entry points cover creation, stepping, position read-back and teardown.
char-cap-title = Capabilities
char-cap-lead = What the character body gives you out of the box.
char-cap-01-title = Collision-safe movement
char-cap-01-desc = shape_cast based resolve means the character never tunnels through walls or floors.
char-cap-02-title = Grounded detection
char-cap-02-desc = character_body_move returns an EffectiveCharacterMovement with the resolved translation and a grounded flag.
char-cap-03-title = No self-collision
char-cap-03-desc = the character's own collider is intentionally omitted so its shape-cast does not catch itself.
char-cap-04-title = Toggleable push
char-cap-04-desc = set_apply_impulses_to_dynamic_bodies lets you disable the momentum transfer, so the character ghosts through dynamic bodies without shoving them.
char-col-title = Collision readback & terrain gravity
char-col-lead = Inspect what the character hit and add slope/terrain-aware free-fall.
char-col-body = character_body_move captures every contact into a ring buffer. Read it back with collision_count + get_collision (each entry names the collider handle, the hit normal and the remaining translation). move_with_terrain adds the world's registered terrain-gravity acceleration to the desired motion, so avatars slide down hills the way they do on a Minecraft terrain collider.
char-col-01-title = Collision enumeration
char-col-01-desc = collision_count returns the number of contacts captured by the last move; get_collision(index) reads one without copying the whole buffer.
char-col-02-title = Terrain-aware move
char-col-02-desc = move_with_terrain folds the terrain-gravity source into the desired displacement; with no source registered it is bit-identical to move.
char-col-03-title = Push dynamic bodies
char-col-03-desc = solve_impulses drives each touched dynamic body toward the character.s intended velocity (from the blocked translation), so the character physically shoves crates and other rigid bodies.
nav-sensor-zone = Sensor Zone
sensor-tag = New body type
sensor-title = Sensor Trigger Zone
sensor-desc = A sensor collider polled for overlaps - no physical response, just trigger events. The fourth body type.
sensor-overview-title = Overview
sensor-overview-lead = The sensor zone is a sensor collider plus an overlap cache.
sensor-overview-body = After each step, call sensor_zone_poll to intersect the zone shape against all world colliders via the broad-phase query pipeline. Overlapping colliders are written into a sticky current set and the zone is marked triggered.
sensor-api-title = C ABI
sensor-api-desc = Nine entry points cover creation, polling, contact enumeration, transform control and teardown.
sensor-cap-title = Capabilities
sensor-cap-lead = What the sensor zone gives you.
sensor-cap-01-title = Overlap detection
sensor-cap-01-desc = poll computes the live set of overlapping colliders via intersect_shape on the broad-phase query pipeline.
sensor-cap-02-title = Sticky trigger flag
sensor-cap-02-desc = is_triggered stays true once any overlap has ever occurred, so event edges are easy to detect.
sensor-cap-03-title = Movable and toggleable
sensor-cap-03-desc = set_translation moves the zone, set_enabled toggles it without recreation.
sensor-cap-04-title = Rising-edge trigger
sensor-cap-04-desc = set_edge switches is_triggered to edge mode: it fires only on the poll where an overlap first appears, then stays false until the zone is emptied and re-entered.
sensor-cap-05-title = Consume and clear
sensor-cap-04-desc = set_edge switches is_triggered to edge mode: it fires only on the poll where an overlap first appears, then stays false until the zone is emptied and re-entered.
sensor-cap-05-desc = sensor_zone_consume read-and-clears the one-shot edge latch (TRUE exactly once per entry); sensor_zone_clear re-arms the zone. No fork changes.
nav-vehicle-controller = Vehicle Controller
veh-tag = New body type
veh-title = Ray-Cast Vehicle Controller
veh-desc = A dynamic chassis body driven by rapier's ray-cast vehicle controller - suspension, wheels, engine force and steering. The fifth body type.
veh-overview-title = Overview
veh-overview-lead = The vehicle controller owns a dynamic chassis rigid body plus rapier's DynamicRayCastVehicleController.
veh-overview-body = You create a chassis with a shape plus translation, add wheels, then each step call vehicle_controller_update with dt. The controller ray-casts the wheels against the world and applies suspension and traction forces to the chassis.
veh-api-title = C ABI
veh-api-desc = Eleven entry points cover creation, wheel setup, force or steer or brake, stepping, read-back and teardown.
veh-cap-title = Capabilities
veh-cap-lead = What the vehicle controller gives you.
veh-cap-01-title = Ray-cast suspension
veh-cap-01-desc = each wheel is a ray against the ground; suspension stiffness, compression, damping and travel are tunable per wheel.
veh-cap-02-title = Drive and steer
veh-cap-02-desc = set_engine_force drives the wheel along the forward axis; set_steering and set_brake control direction and grip.
veh-cap-03-title = Ground telemetry
veh-cap-03-desc = wheel_on_ground and wheel_contact_normal report per-wheel contact so you can build traction logic.

# ── Character Body: Minecraft-style tuning (added in Phase 3c batch)
char-mc-title = Minecraft-style tuning
char-mc-lead = Every knob a Minecraft-style mod packs into its character controller is exposed as a one-line setter, mirror-compatible with Mojang's KinematicCharacterController.
char-mc-01-title = Up axis and offset
char-mc-01-desc = set_up rotates the controller for non-Y-up worlds; set_offset_absolute / set_offset_relative shift the capsule against its rigid-body frame.
char-mc-02-title = Auto-step
char-mc-02-desc = set_autostep toggles stair/step climbing with max height, min width and an include-dynamic flag that lets the character mount moving platforms.
char-mc-03-title = Snap to ground
char-mc-03-desc = set_snap_to_ground keeps the controller glued to slopes and stairs within a configurable distance, so it never floats on vertical seams.
char-mc-04-title = Slope limits and slide
char-mc-04-desc = set_slope_angles clamps the max climb and min slide angles; set_slide lets the controller slide down otherwise-unclimbable slopes. is_grounded / is_on_ground / is_sliding_down_slope read the last move.
char-mc-note = is_on_ground is the hybrid Minecraft jump-gate: grounded OR resting on a slope (translation.y >= 0). is_grounded tracks rapier's raw grounded flag; read both when you build a jump system.

//! Cross-crate **version-constant consistency** lock (OPTIMIZATION.md §N6).
//!
//! This is the generalisation of [`error_consistency`] (§1) and
//! [`arena_compat`] (§10): the project has more than one "abstraction-level
//! cross-crate identically-named const" pair that exists *only* because
//! cbindgen does not follow `pub use` — namely:
//!
//! | pair                                  | formula/core side                | used by (Java/foreign side) |
//! |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
//! | `ERR_*` (7 items)                     | mps-formula::error / rapier::error | indirect, header-only       |
//! | `ARENA_VERSION`                       | mps_core::rapier::shared_arena   | mps-ffm                     |
//! | `ABI_VERSION`                         | mps-ffm                          | Java-side `IllegalStateException` 防呆 |
//!
//! The two version constants (`ARENA_VERSION` and `ABI_VERSION`) are the
//! most ABI-sensitive of all: if they drift out of the contract documented
//! below without a coordinated bump, downstream Java consumers may either:
//!
//! - read shifted bytes (ARENA_VERSION bumps alone → silent data corruption)
//! - reject all increment/deserializable calls (ABI_VERSION bumps alone →
//!   Java-side `IllegalStateException` 即使 arena layout 完全没变).
//!
//! This module does **not** assert `ARENA_VERSION == ABI_VERSION` — those
//! are deliberately **distinct numbers** tracking **different concerns**:
//!
//! - `ARENA_VERSION = 2` pins the binary layout of the shared-memory ring
//!   (slot strides, header size, slot capacities).
//! - `ABI_VERSION = 1` pins the **top-level** foreign-function entry-point
//!   surface as seen by Java via `mps-ffm::abi_version()`.
//!
//! What this module *does* enforce:
//!
//! 1. **Pin current values centrally** so a drift on either side surfaces as
//!    a single, CI-noisy failure with a precise hint.
//! 2. **Mirror the values into arena_compat.rs's existing lock** — if the
//!    two test modules disagree on the canonical "current values", CI fails.
//! 3. **Bump-path reminder**: every assertion message names the upgrade
//!    procedure so the next maintainer hits a one-line actionable hint.
//!
//! See also: `arena_compat.rs` (locks the 11 stride/cap constants + ABI_VERSION
//! ⇒ arena-layout contract).
